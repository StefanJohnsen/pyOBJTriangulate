# pyOBJTriangulate
Wavefront OBJ files typically consist of triangles, but they can also include quads and polygons. This script aims to convert all quads and polygons found in an OBJ file and create a new OBJ file containing only triangles.

```
python main.py <source objfile> <target objfile>
```
